## Setting up SSH for github

Run the following commands in your local computer:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Now, you should add your ssh key to your github account according to this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

In the next step, you can test your ssh connection by running the following command:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

git clone [remote-address]
```

## Adding upstream branch

```bash
git branch -u origin [upstream-branch]
```

```bash
git checkout -b <new-branch>
```

## Switching between branches

```bash
git checkout <target-branch>
```

## Getting latest changes from remote
